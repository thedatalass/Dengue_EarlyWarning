## Daily | Campinas district Sao Paulo, Brazil (Oct 2006-Sept 2007)
Predictor features - mild or severe confirmed dengue case by person, income, household water delivery, water shortages, water storage
practices, garbage present around home, garbage collection frequency per week, household experience with floods, reports of bites 
during the day, basic indoor plumbing, occurence of mosquito breeding sites, number of sites, presence of larvae, home address.
Result - crude odds ratios --but cannot conclude from data which variables are most significant

Predictor features - number of monthly dengue cases (555 cases)
Result - mean number of outbreaks
Citation - Brady, Oliver. J. et al. Dengue disease outbreak definitions are implicitly variable

## Daily | 457 urban villages of Kaohsiung City, Taiwain (2009-2012)
Predictor features - number of daily dengue cases
Result - threshold cut points that village will have higher odds of getting more cases in upcoming 14 days

## Daily Mosquito exposed to viruses in Louisiana (2015)
Predictor features - extrinsic factors (viral strain type, temperature, humidity) & intrinsic factors (incubation period)
Results - Mosquito infection and dissemination may alter long-term mortality rate with increased temperatures. Mosquito lifespan
also longer at lower temperatures in other studies.
