## Daily Mosquito exposed to viruses in Louisiana (2015)
Predictor features - extrinsic factors (viral strain type, temperature, humidity) & intrinsic factors (incubation period)
Results - Mosquito infection and dissemination may alter long-term mortality rate with increased temperatures. Mosquito lifespan
also longer at lower temperatures in other studies.
